# What is this?

This is a work in progress. Some day it will be a cool site about math and JavaScript. It will feature math stuff, like:

And code editor stuff like:

```js
// Create some text
text("Hello, world!", 50, 50, {
  fontSize: 32,
  fill: "blue"
});

// And a random rectangle
rect(50, 50, totalWidth - 50, 0);
```
