# What is this?

This is a work in progress. Some day it will be a cool site about learning JavaScript using an interactive drawing
 setup.

It will be based around code-samples like the following:

```js height=220
$rect($stageWidth/2, $stageHeight/2, $stageWidth/4, $stageHeight/4, {
  fill: "purple"
});

$text("Hello world!", $stageWidth/2 - 45, $stageHeight/2, {
  align: "center",
  fill: "white"
});
```

Here is some more text.
